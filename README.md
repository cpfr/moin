# moin

** *moin* ** is a *Monty* interpreter implemented in pure *Javascript* using the parser generator PEG.js ( see also http://pegjs.org/). Besides the *Monty* compiler ** *moco* **, it is the second attempt to implement the language.

### Status
** *moin* ** is still in development and does not cover the whole language.
